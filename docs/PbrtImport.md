# pbrt v4 scene import

skinny can read a [pbrt v4](https://pbrt.org) text scene and convert it into a
USD stage that the existing `usd_loader` pipeline loads unchanged. The goal is
**near-matching images** between skinny and pbrt v4 for the same scene, validated
by an automated error gate. Direction is **import-only** (pbrt → skinny); the
"exporter" is the pbrt → skinny converter itself.

The implementation lives in `src/skinny/pbrt/` and emits USD via `pxr`
(UsdGeom / UsdLux / UsdPreviewSurface), carrying skinny-specific extensions in
`customData.skinnyOverrides`.

## Usage

```bash
# CLI
.venv/bin/skinny-import-pbrt scene.pbrt -o scene.usda
# module form
.venv/bin/python -m skinny.pbrt scene.pbrt -o scene.usda
```

```python
from skinny.pbrt import import_pbrt

stage, report = import_pbrt("scene.pbrt", out="scene.usda")
print(report)        # exact / approx / skipped per construct
# scene.usda now loads via Renderer(usd_scene_path="scene.usda")
```

The CLI exits non-zero when any construct was **unsupported** (skipped), so
scripts can gate on a clean import. The translation report classifies every
construct as `exact`, `approx`, or `skipped` with a reason — nothing is silently
dropped.

## How it works

| Stage | Module | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Tokenize | `tokenizer.py` | comments, quoted strings, numbers, `[..]` arrays |
| Parse directives | `parser.py` | typed `"type name" [values]` params, `Include`/`Import`, options/world split |
| Graphics state | `state.py` | CTM stack, named materials/textures, area-light state, reverse-orientation, `ObjectInstance` instancing → IR |
| Transforms | `transform.py` | column-vector 4×4; left→right-handed bridge |
| Spectra → RGB | `spectra.py` | CIE (analytic) + blackbody + named metals |
| Materials | `materials.py` | pbrt material → UsdPreviewSurface |
| Lights | `lights.py` | pbrt light → UsdLux / emissive mesh |
| Camera | `camera.py` | `perspective` fov-axis conversion; `realistic` lens |
| Media/SSS | `media.py` | homogeneous + subsurface best-effort via `customData` |
| Emit USD | `emit.py`, `api.py` | baked world-space meshes, UsdShade networks |

### Coordinate bridge

pbrt is left-handed; skinny/USD is right-handed. Every CTM is mapped by the fixed
change-of-basis `B = diag(1, 1, -1, 1)` (`M → B·M·B`, point `p → B·p`). Because
`B` is a reflection it reverses triangle winding, so geometry baked through the
bake matrix `B·CTM` has its winding flipped when that matrix is
orientation-reversing (XOR the per-shape `ReverseOrientation`). Geometry is baked
to **world-space points with an identity transform**, which sidesteps USD xform
handedness entirely; the camera and lights use authored xforms verified against
the loader.

### Roughness calibration (parity-critical)

- pbrt v4: `alpha = sqrt(roughness)` when `remaproughness` (default), else
  `alpha = roughness`.
- skinny GGX: `alpha = usd_roughness²` (UsdPreviewSurface roughness passes
  straight through).
- therefore the emitted `usd_roughness = sqrt(alpha)`.

Anisotropic `uroughness`/`vroughness` are reduced to an isotropic alpha
(geometric mean) and flagged.

### Spectrum → RGB

skinny is an RGB renderer, so every spectrum is reduced to linear RGB: `rgb`
params pass through; `blackbody [T]` integrates a Planckian SPD against the CIE
XYZ colour-matching functions (Wyman–Sloan–Shirley analytic fit) then XYZ → linear
sRGB; named conductor spectra (`metal-Au-eta`/`-k`) map to a tabulated RGB IOR;
inline sampled spectra integrate directly. The residual RGB-vs-spectral
divergence is inherent and is absorbed by the per-scene parity tolerance.

## Parity validation

The corpus under `tests/pbrt/corpus/` holds small (≤128 px) scenes, each
isolating one parity axis, plus a `manifest.json` of per-scene tolerances. The
harness (`parity.py`) imports a scene, renders it in skinny via the headless
path, reads the **linear-HDR accumulation** (not the tonemapped sRGB display),
and compares it to a checked-in pbrt v4 reference EXR with two metrics:

- **relMSE** — `mean((a-b)² / (b² + ε))` on linear RGB (robust to a residual
  global scale and to Monte-Carlo noise; a least-squares exposure scalar is
  applied first).
- **FLIP** — a FLIP-style perceptual difference on identically-tonemapped copies.

The gate runs with **no pbrt binary** present — it relies solely on the committed
reference EXRs (`tests/pbrt/test_parity.py`, marked `gpu`). Until the references
are generated it skips, and only the import-smoke checks run.

> **Reference generation (offline).** Render each corpus `.pbrt` with a pbrt v4
> binary at the manifest resolution/spp into `tests/pbrt/corpus/refs/<name>.exr`,
> force-add them (`git add -f` — the repo `.gitignore` is `*`), then pin the pbrt
> version in the manifest and tighten the tolerances to the measured error.

## Parity matrix

Support status per pbrt feature. "Measured error" is filled in once reference
EXRs exist (pending a pbrt v4 binary on the build host).
