# Skinny — ReSTIR DI

This document is the implementation reference for **ReSTIR DI** (Reservoir-based
SpatioTemporal Importance Resampling for **Direct Illumination**) — skinny's
first non-identity *reuse* mode and the variance-reduction estimator for
primary-hit direct lighting. It covers the rendering stages, the governing
equations and the exact shader symbols that realize them, the design choices, the
GUI controls, and the source papers.

ReSTIR plugs into the **scene-sampling reuse seam** (the `ReusePlugin` socket
reserved by the sampling change). The seam and the wavefront execution backend it
rides on are documented in [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) (descriptor
binding map) and [Wavefront.md](Wavefront.md) (the bounce-0 reuse hook); the
generic path/BDPT integrators live in [README.md](../README.md). The
pre-implementation brainstorm and its decision history are archived at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-restir-di-design.md` — **this document
describes the shipped code**, which deviates from that brainstorm in a few places
(noted below).

## What ReSTIR DI is

Stock next-event estimation (NEE) draws a fresh light sample per pixel per frame
and immediately pays a shadow ray for it. When a scene has many emissive
triangles or a large area light, most of those samples are poor (wrong light,
occluded, grazing), so the direct-lighting estimate is noisy and shadow rays are
wasted on bad candidates.

ReSTIR DI instead keeps a **reservoir** per pixel — a single surviving light
sample distilled from a stream of candidates by *resampled importance sampling*
(RIS) — and then **reuses** that reservoir across screen-space neighbours (and,
optionally, across accumulation frames). Two ideas make it cheap and effective:

- **Deferred visibility.** Candidates are scored by an *unshadowed* target p̂;
  only the single survivor pays a shadow ray. A pixel evaluates dozens of
  candidates for the price of one shadow ray.
- **Spatial reuse.** A pixel borrows its neighbours' surviving samples, so the
  effective candidate count per pixel grows far beyond what it sampled itself —
  the variance reduction.

![Initial RIS at the primary hit: many unshadowed candidate rays to the lights, one survivor that pays the single shadow ray](diagrams/restir/fig_initial_ris.svg)

ReSTIR DI **converges to the same direct-lighting integral as stock NEE** (it is
unbiased in the default regime) while reaching a given noise level at a lower
sample count.

### Scope and limits

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | **Wavefront only**, on both Vulkan and native Metal (change `metal-wavefront-parity`: `metal_wavefront.MetalRestirDiPass`, bit-identical to the Vulkan pass set on this host). The megakernel on either device falls back to identity (stock NEE) — `reuseMode` folds to 0 in `renderer._pack_uniforms`. |
| Vertices | **Primary hit only** (`depth == 0`). Secondary path vertices (`depth ≥ 1`) keep stock NEE. |
| Materials | **Flat / standard_surface / OpenPBR only.** `restirLoadLane` gates on `MATERIAL_TYPE_FLAT`; skin / MaterialX-graph / python-material lanes pass through to stock NEE. |
| Light types | Sphere + emissive-triangle + environment in the unified RIS; **directional (delta) lights are plain NEE** outside the RIS. |
| Default regime | **Spatial only** (unbiased GRIS). Temporal regimes are selectable but progressive-limited (see [Caveats](#caveats-and-limits)). |

## Stages of rendering

ReSTIR runs as a three-pass burst at **bounce 0**, scheduled by the wavefront
path pass's reuse hook (`vk_wavefront.WavefrontPathPass.record` → `RestirDiPass.
record_primary_direct`) *after* the primary intersect populates `wfHits[]` and
*before* the shade kernel runs. Because ReSTIR now owns primary direct, the shade
kernel's depth-0 direct terms are **gated off** (see [Canonical
integration](#canonical-integration)).

![ReSTIR DI fill → spatial → resolve pipeline](diagrams/restir_pipeline.svg)

The three passes (`restir/restir_primary.slang`, dispatched in order with a
memory barrier between each by `RestirDiPass.record_primary_direct`):

1. **`restirFill`** — initial RIS. For each live flat primary-hit lane, stream
   M_light light-sampled + M_bsdf BSDF-sampled candidates through a reservoir
   using the *unshadowed* target p̂. Writes `reservoirA[i]` and the G-buffer
   record `{pos, normal}[i]`. No shadow rays.
2. **`restirSpatial`** — spatiotemporal merge. Combine the pixel's own reservoir
   with up to `spatialK` domain-checked screen neighbours (from `reservoirA`) and,
   if the temporal flag is set, last frame's reservoir (from `reservoirB`). The
   default is the **unbiased GRIS** combination; a **biased ΣM** toggle is the
   faster alternative. Writes `reservoirB[i]`.
3. **`restirResolve`** — shade. Read the merged `reservoirB[i]`, cast **one
   shadow ray** for the surviving sample, and add f·V·W (plus directional NEE)
   into the path-state radiance.

`reservoirB` **persists across accumulation frames**, so the next frame's
`restirSpatial` can read it as temporal history (M-capped). The reservoir buffers
are double-buffered (`A`/`B` ping-pong); the G-buffer backs the spatial-neighbour
domain check.

### Per-pixel state

```hlsl
// restir/reservoir.slang
struct LightSampleRef {       // unified over all RIS light types
    uint   packed;            // lightType:2 | lightId:30
    float2 uv;                // point-on-light param, or octahedral env direction
};
struct Reservoir {
    LightSampleRef y;         // surviving sample
    float wSum;               // sum of RIS weights seen
    float W;                  // contribution weight = wSum / (M * pHat(y))
    uint  M;                  // candidate count (capped for temporal reuse)
    float pHat;               // cached target pHat(y)
};
struct GBuf { float3 pos; float3 normal; };   // restir/restir_primary.slang
```

A `LightSampleRef` is a **reproducible, shading-point-independent** reference: for
sphere/triangle lights the `uv` maps to a fixed world point (recoverable even
from a BSDF ray hit via `sphereUVFromPoint`); for the environment the `uv` is the
octahedral-encoded direction (`octEncode`/`octDecode`). This independence is what
lets resolve and spatial/temporal reuse re-derive the *same* light at *any* pixel
— the **DI reconnection**.

## Equations

Notation: f is the BSDF response including the cosine term
(`mat.evaluate(wo, wi).response`); Le is the light's emitted radiance; V is binary
visibility; lum(·) is luminance. All directions are at the primary shading point.

### 1. Resampled importance sampling (RIS)

Candidates xᵢ are drawn from a source pdf p_src. Each carries a resampling weight
and a target value:

![w_i = pHat(x_i) / p_src(x_i)](diagrams/restir/ris-weight.svg)

The reservoir keeps **one** survivor y, selected with probability proportional to
wᵢ (streaming weighted reservoir sampling). After the stream the **unbiased
contribution weight** is

![W = (sum_i w_i) / (M · pHat(y))](diagrams/restir/ris-W.svg)

and the estimate of the integral is f(y)·W — unbiased for any M whenever p̂ > 0
wherever the true integrand f ≠ 0. *(Talbot et al. 2005; Bitterli et al. 2020.)*

> **Implements:** `reservoirUpdate` (the `rand * wSum < w` survivor test) and
> `reservoirFinalize` (`W = wSum / (M·p̂)`) in `restir/reservoir.slang`.

`reservoirUpdate` streams one candidate and keeps the survivor with probability ∝ wᵢ:

<!-- CODE:ris-w body -->
```slang
// from reservoir.slang
bool reservoirUpdate(inout Reservoir r, LightSampleRef x, float w, float pHat_x, float rand)
{
    r.wSum += w;
    r.M += 1u;
    bool take = (w > 0.0) && (rand * r.wSum < w);
    if (take)
    {
        r.y = x;
        r.pHat = pHat_x;
    }
    return take;
}
```
<!-- /CODE:ris-w -->

| symbol | code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wᵢ | `w` | candidate RIS weight p̂(xᵢ)/p_src(xᵢ) (caller-supplied) |
| Σwᵢ | `r.wSum` | running sum of resampling weights |
| M | `r.M` | candidate count |
| y | `r.y` | surviving sample |
| p̂(y) | `r.pHat` | cached target value of the survivor |

`reservoirFinalize` turns the stream into the unbiased contribution weight W:

<!-- CODE:ris-W body -->
```slang
// from reservoir.slang
void reservoirFinalize(inout Reservoir r)
{
    float denom = float(r.M) * r.pHat;
    r.W = (denom > 0.0) ? r.wSum / denom : 0.0;
}
```
<!-- /CODE:ris-W -->

| symbol | code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W | `r.W` | contribution weight Σwᵢ/(M·p̂(y)) |
| M·p̂(y) | `denom` | normaliser (0 ⇒ W = 0) |

![RIS resamples M proposal draws toward the target p̂; the survivor approaches the target distribution as M grows](diagrams/restir/fig_ris_resample.svg)

### 2. The target function p̂ (unshadowed, unweighted)

skinny's RIS owns *all* of primary direct (canonical integration, Decision 5), so
the target is the unshadowed, **MIS-unweighted** light contribution:

![pHat = lum(f · Le)](diagrams/restir/target.svg)

Visibility V is deliberately **not** in p̂ — it is deferred to the single
resolve-time shadow ray. p̂ is a scalar (luminance) so the reservoir stores one
float; the resolve multiplies the cached RGB integrand f·Le by V·W.

> (`c.integrand = b.response * Le; c.pHat = lum(c.integrand)`).

<!-- CODE:target sig,core -->
```slang

    // …
    float3 wi = worldToTangent(dir, T, B, N);
    BSDFSample b = mat.evaluate(wo, wi);
    c.integrand = b.response * Le;                   // UNWEIGHTED (MIS lives in p_mix)
    c.pHat = _luminance(c.integrand);
    c.pdfLightSA = pdfLightSA;
    c.pdfBsdf = _misPdf(mat, h, N, T, B, wo, wi);
```
<!-- /CODE:target -->

| Le | `Le` | light radiance |
| f·Le | `c.integrand` | unweighted RGB integrand (cached for resolve) |
| p̂ | `c.pHat` | scalar target = lum(f·Le) |

### 3. The mixture source pdf (light + BSDF candidates)

`restirFill` mixes two candidate techniques — light sampling and BSDF sampling —
into one estimator. By the balance heuristic *(Veach 1997)* the correct source
pdf for a candidate direction ωᵢ is the **mixture pdf** over both techniques:

![p_mix(omega_i) = (M_light·p_light + M_bsdf·p_bsdf·[->sphere|env]) / (M_light + M_bsdf)](diagrams/restir/pmix.svg)

- p_light(ωᵢ) = p_light^Ω / n_tech — a single light technique is chosen uniformly
  among the n_tech active ones (sphere count + a triangle slot + an env slot), so
  its pdf is divided by n_tech.
- The area-light solid-angle pdf is the area pdf converted by the geometry term:
  p_light^Ω = d²·p_area / cosθ_light. For the environment,
  p_light^Ω = `envPdf(ωᵢ)` (the importance-sampling cell distribution).
- p_bsdf(ωᵢ) is the proposal-mixture pdf (`mixtureProposalPdf`), and it is only
  included for candidates the BSDF technique can actually hit — **sphere and env**
  (`isSE`). Emissive triangles are NEE-only in the stock renderer (no BSDF-tri MIS
  term), so they are sampled by the light technique only; the estimator stays
  unbiased (any unbiased estimator converges to the same integral).

Each candidate's RIS weight is then w = p̂ / p_mix.

> **Implements:** `_mixPdf` and the `w = c.pHat / src` lines in
> `restirFillReservoir` (`restir/light_ris.slang`). Every drawn candidate counts
> toward M, including invalid/occluded ones (which stream with w = 0).

The area→solid-angle conversion (inside `restirEvalRef`) and the balance-heuristic
mixture pdf (`_mixPdf`):

<!-- CODE:pmix area,mix -->
```slang
// from light_ris.slang
        pdfLightSA = d2 * ls.pdfArea / cosLight;     // area → solid-angle measure
    // …
float _mixPdf(RCand c, uint nTech, uint mLight, uint mBsdf)
{
    float pLight = c.pdfLightSA / float(max(nTech, 1u));
    float pBsdf  = c.isSE ? c.pdfBsdf : 0.0;
    return (float(mLight) * pLight + float(mBsdf) * pBsdf) / float(max(mLight + mBsdf, 1u));
}
```
<!-- /CODE:pmix -->

| symbol | code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p_light^Ω | `pdfLightSA` | light pdf in solid-angle measure |
| d²·p_area/cosθ | `d2 * ls.pdfArea / cosLight` | area→SA geometry conversion |
| p_light | `pLight` | per-technique light pdf (÷ n_tech) |
| p_bsdf | `pBsdf` | BSDF proposal pdf, sphere/env only (`c.isSE`) |
| M_light, M_bsdf | `mLight`, `mBsdf` | candidate counts per technique |
| p_mix | return value | balance-heuristic source pdf |

### 4. Combining reservoirs (the merge)

Two reservoirs combine by treating one as a single *supercandidate*. Source
`src` merged into `dst` contributes

![w = pHat_dst(src.y) · src.W · src.M](diagrams/restir/merge.svg)

where p̂_dst is `src`'s surviving sample re-evaluated **in `dst`'s domain** (its
shading point + material). Combining reservoirs this way is the unbiased
multi-reservoir RIS combination *(Bitterli 2020, Alg. 4)*: each source contributes
its W·M·p̂, the survivor is chosen ∝ those weights, and finalize yields the
combined contribution weight over ΣM samples.

> **Implements:** `reservoirMerge` in `restir/reservoir.slang`. This is the
> building block; `restirSpatial` uses the explicit per-source form below so it
> can apply per-domain MIS weights.

<!-- CODE:merge body -->
```slang
// from reservoir.slang
bool reservoirMerge(inout Reservoir dst, Reservoir src, float pHatInDst, float rand)
{
    float w = pHatInDst * src.W * float(src.M);
    dst.wSum += w;
    dst.M += src.M;
    bool take = (w > 0.0) && (rand * dst.wSum < w);
    if (take)
    {
        dst.y = src.y;
        dst.pHat = pHatInDst;
    }
    return take;
}
```
<!-- /CODE:merge -->

| symbol | code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| p̂_dst(src.y) | `pHatInDst` | src's survivor re-evaluated in dst's domain |
| src.W, src.M | `src.W`, `src.M` | source contribution weight + count |
| w | `w` | supercandidate weight p̂_dst·src.W·src.M |
| ΣM | `dst.M` | combined sample count |

### 5. Unbiased spatiotemporal combination (GRIS)

The naive ΣM merge over neighbours is biased: a sample that many neighbours could
have produced is over-counted, which on glossy surfaces lets spatial→temporal
feedback over-brighten the image (measured up to ~48% vs path tracing). The fix is
the **generalized balance heuristic** *(Lin et al. 2022, GRIS)*. Each source
sample z_s is combined with the MIS weight

![m_s = M_s·pHat_s(z_s) / sum_j M_j·pHat_j(z_s)](diagrams/restir/gris-ms.svg)

where p̂_j(z_s) is z_s's target re-evaluated in **source j's own domain** (its
shading point + material, re-loaded from `wfHits[j]`). The per-source resampling
weight at the canonical pixel q is

![w_s = m_s · pHat_q(z_s) · W_s](diagrams/restir/gris-ws.svg)

the survivor Y is chosen ∝ w_s, and the output contribution weight is

![W_out = (sum_s w_s) / pHat_q(Y)](diagrams/restir/gris-Wout.svg)

where the m_s already normalize, so there is no 1/M and no 1/Z factor.

**Reconnection Jacobian.** Reusing a neighbour's sample at this pixel is a *shift
map*; GRIS weights it by the shift's Jacobian. For DI the shift reuses the **same
world light point** (the `uv` is shading-point-independent), so the shift is the
identity and **the Jacobian is 1**; the geometry/BSDF change between domains is
captured entirely by the per-domain p̂ re-evaluation.

### 6. Biased combination (ΣM toggle)

The `biased` toggle replaces GRIS with the simple ΣM combination *(Bitterli 2020,
Alg. 4)* — each source weighted by p̂_q(z_s)·W_s·M_s, normalized by ΣM:

![W = (sum_s pHat_q(z_s)·W_s·M_s) / ((sum_s M_s)·pHat(Y))](diagrams/restir/biased.svg)

It skips the O(K²) per-domain p̂ re-evaluation (the GRIS denominator), so it is
faster, but biased — discontinuity darkening on spatial-only, and over-brightening
with temporal on glossy via the feedback the m_s would have bounded.

### 7. Resolve and directional lights

Resolve casts one shadow ray for the survivor and adds the RGB estimate; the
cached unweighted integrand f·Le is multiplied by V·W:

![direct = f(y) · Le(y) · V(y) · W](diagrams/restir/resolve.svg)

Directional (delta) lights are handled separately by plain NEE **outside** the
RIS (no MIS, they cannot be BSDF-sampled):

![direct_dir = sum_d f(omega_i,d) · Le,d · V_d](diagrams/restir/resolve-dir.svg)

> **Implements:** `restirResolveReservoir` (area: `visibleSegment`; env:
> `visibleDirectional`) and `restirDirectional` in `restir/light_ris.slang`,
> summed in `restirResolve`.

`restirResolveReservoir` casts the survivor's single shadow ray and scales the
cached integrand by V·W:

<!-- CODE:resolve sig,core -->
```slang

                       : visibleSegment(fc, h.position, c.toPoint);

`restirDirectional` adds delta (directional) lights by plain NEE, outside the RIS:

<!-- CODE:resolve-dir sig,core -->
```slang

## Design choices

Six decisions were locked during the brainstorm; the shipped code follows them
with the deviations noted.

1. **Regimes — nested, all selectable.** `spatial` (on/off) × `temporal` (off /
   progressive / reprojected). Spatial-only and progressive-temporal fit skinny's
   progressive accumulator with no new infrastructure; **reprojected temporal**
   needs motion vectors + a prev-frame G-buffer and is **deferred to a follow-on
   change** (reserved in the selector).
2. **Scope — primary-hit, screen-space.** Per-pixel reservoirs at the primary
   visible point (the main visual). Secondary vertices have no screen-space pixel,
   so indirect bounces keep stock NEE.
3. **Light domain — unified.** One reservoir resamples sphere + emissive-triangle
   + env; a sample is `(lightType, lightId, point-on-light)`. Directional lights
   are delta → plain NEE outside the RIS.
4. **Bias — unbiased default + biased toggle.** Default to the unbiased
   combination; expose `biased` as a faster toggle. Matches the renderer's other
   unbiasedness gates (furnace mode, the parity tests).
5. **Integration — canonical, RIS owns primary direct.** Candidate generation
   mixes light- and BSDF-sampled candidates; the path tracer skips its depth-0
   light/sphere/env direct terms (ReSTIR counted them). The proposal mixture still
   drives the bounce *direction* for indirect.
6. **Backend — wavefront-only.** Multi-pass reuse can't live in the megakernel;
   selecting ReSTIR + megakernel falls back to identity (capability gate, like
   wavefront-BDPT). Both wavefront backends run it: Vulkan
   (`vk_wavefront.RestirDiPass`) and native Metal
   (`metal_wavefront.MetalRestirDiPass`, change `metal-wavefront-parity`).

### Canonical integration (RIS owns primary direct)

Because the RIS counts *all* of primary direct, the path tracer's own depth-0
direct terms must be suppressed to avoid double-counting:

- **Light-NEE half:** `reuseDirect` (`sampling/reuse.slang`) returns zero at
  `depth == 0` under `reuseMode == RESTIR_DI`.
- **BSDF-sampled sphere hit:** gated by `restirOwns` in `wf_shade_common.slang:126`
  (`reuseMode == 1 && depth == 0 && !transmitted`).
- **BSDF-sampled env miss:** the depth-0-spawned ray's env-miss direct term is
  skipped in `wavefront_path.slang:129`.

The light-NEE gate is the whole of `reuseDirect`:

<!-- CODE:gate body -->
```slang
// from reuse.slang
float3 reuseDirect<TM : IMaterial>(
    TM mat, HitInfo h, float3 N, float3 T, float3 B, float3 wo,
    uint depth, bool neuralActive, inout RNG rng)
{
    // Primary-hit direct owned by ReSTIR: gate the inline estimate at the
    // primary vertex so the reservoir resolve pass is its sole source.
    if (fc.reuseMode == REUSE_RESTIR_DI && depth == 0u)
        return float3(0.0);
    return allLightsNEE(mat, h, N, T, B, wo, neuralActive, rng);
}
```
<!-- /CODE:gate -->

| symbol | code | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reuseMode | `fc.reuseMode` | active reuse selector (`REUSE_RESTIR_DI` = 1) |
| depth 0 | `depth == 0u` | primary vertex (RIS owns it ⇒ return 0) |
| depth ≥ 1 | else branch | stock `allLightsNEE` (proposal-mixture-coupled) |

`depth ≥ 1` vertices are untouched (stock NEE + the proposal mixture). Identity
reuse (`reuse=none`) keeps the pre-ReSTIR behaviour exactly.

### Shipped deviations

- **Canonical integration (Decision 5) shipped fully.** The earlier merged
  starting point was a light-only RIS composing with shade's still-active BSDF
  half; it was replaced by the canonical form with the unweighted target and the
  mixture source pdf, and the depth-0 BSDF-sphere/env-miss terms gated off.
- **Unbiased = GRIS, not the bare 1/Z.** The brainstorm anticipated a 1/Z
  domain-count normalization; the implementation uses the stronger GRIS balance
  heuristic m_s (§5), which bounds the glossy spatial→temporal feedback the naive
  ΣM let explode. No fat G-buffer is needed — each source's material is re-loaded
  from `wfHits[j]`.
- **Default regime = Spatial only.** On the progressive accumulator, temporal
  reuse double-counts correlated history; spatial GRIS is the unbiased,
  variance-reducing default (see [Caveats](#caveats-and-limits)).
- **Env refs are octahedral.** Environment candidates store the direction
  octahedral-encoded in `LightSampleRef.uv`, so an env sample is as reproducible
  as an area-light point.
- **Separate RNG stream.** `restirFill` seeds its RNG from
  `pcgHash(rngState ^ 0x9e3779b9)` so it does not consume the shade kernel's
  cursor.

## GUI controls

ReSTIR's controls live in a **dedicated `ReSTIR` group**, defined once in the
shared control tree (`ui/build_app_ui.py`: `_classify` buckets
`reuse_index` + any `restir_*` path into the group) and inherited identically by
the windowed app, the Qt GUI, the web/Panel server, and the debug viewport. The
group is always present (it carries the `Reuse` enabler) and sits right after the
`Render` group. The seven tuning controls are only effective when `Reuse =
ReSTIR DI`.

| Control | Param path | Range / options | Maps to | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Reuse** | `reuse_index` | None · ReSTIR DI | `fc.reuseMode` (0 / 1) | Selects identity vs ReSTIR. Triggers a wavefront pass rebuild. |
| **ReSTIR regime** | `restir_regime_index` | Spatial only · Spatial + Temporal · Temporal only | `flags` bit0/bit1 via `_RESTIR_REGIME_FLAGS = [0x1, 0x3, 0x2]` | Which reuse axes are active. Triggers a pass rebuild. |
| **ReSTIR combine** | `restir_biased` | Unbiased (GRIS) · Biased (ΣM) | `flags` OR 0x4 when biased | GRIS vs ΣM combination (§5 vs §6). |
| **ReSTIR M light** | `restir_m_light` | 1 – 64 | `rpc.mLight` (M_light) | Light-sampled candidates per pixel in fill. |
| **ReSTIR M bsdf** | `restir_m_bsdf` | 0 – 8 | `rpc.mBsdf` (M_bsdf) | BSDF-sampled candidates per pixel in fill. |
| **ReSTIR neighbours** | `restir_spatial_k` | 0 – 8 | `rpc.spatialK` | Spatial neighbours merged in `restirSpatial`. |
| **ReSTIR radius** | `restir_spatial_radius` | 1 – 64 | `rpc.spatialRadius` (screen px) | Neighbour search radius. |
| **ReSTIR M cap** | `restir_m_cap` | 1 – 64 | `rpc.mCap` (M_cap) | Temporal history cap (limits prev-frame M). |

The full push constant is `RestirPC` (36 B scalar:
`streamSize, flags, mLight, spatialK, spatialRadius, normalThresh, depthThresh,
mCap, mBsdf`), packed by `RestirDiPass.record_primary_direct`. The
domain-rejection thresholds `normalThresh` (0.9) and `depthThresh` (0.1) are
config defaults on `RestirDiReuse`, not GUI-exposed.

**Live vs rebuild.** The tuning controls (`mLight`, `mBsdf`, `spatialK`,
`spatialRadius`, `mCap`, `biased`) are push-constant only — the renderer refreshes
`RestirDiPass.config` from `_restir_build_config` each frame, so changes take
effect **without a pass rebuild**. The `Reuse` mode and the `regime` are part of
the pass-rebuild key (the seam's pass-structural contract). **Every** change —
mode, regime, or any tuning value — resets progressive accumulation (folded into
`_current_state_hash`), so the new configuration converges cleanly.

## Caveats and limits

- **Wavefront-only.** The megakernel (on either device) silently falls back to
  identity (stock NEE); `reuseMode` folds to 0 in `_pack_uniforms` there. The
  wavefront backend runs ReSTIR on both Vulkan and native Metal.
- **Flat materials only.** `restirLoadLane` accepts only `MATERIAL_TYPE_FLAT`
  primary hits; skin / MaterialX-graph / python-material lanes pass through
  `restirSpatial` untouched and shade with stock NEE.
- **Temporal on a progressive accumulator double-counts.** skinny accumulates by
  averaging frames; carrying a reservoir across frames feeds correlated history
  back in, so the bias grows with M_cap and shows on glossy surfaces. The
  "temporal beats spatial" property belongs to the real-time **reprojected**
  regime (the P3 follow-on), not the progressive accumulator. **Spatial-only
  (unbiased GRIS) is the default and the recommended regime.**

  ![Progressive temporal reuse: the M-capped previous-frame reservoir is merged into the current frame's and persists onward](diagrams/restir/fig_temporal_reuse.svg)

- **Reprojected temporal is reserved.** Selecting it falls back to a supported
  regime until the motion-vector subsystem lands.

## Verification

ReSTIR DI is validated against stock NEE as the reference:

- `tests/test_restir.py` — the RIS core (`reservoirUpdate`/`Finalize` selection ∝
  weight and W) unit-tested in isolation via the synthetic harness.
- `tests/test_restir_lights.py` — unified light-domain candidate generation.
- `tests/test_restir_render.py` — converges to the `reuse=none` reference on
  emissive / area-light scenes (the unbiased gate).
- `tests/test_restir_variance.py` + `assets/restir_variance_demo.usda` — variance
  reduction: ~30% lower RMSE than NEE at equal low sample count.

![Equal low sample count: stock NEE is noisy, ReSTIR DI spatial reuse is far smoother](diagrams/restir/fig_variance.svg)

The unbiased spatial regime has been A/B-verified against megakernel path
tracing, BDPT, and wavefront NEE on `cornell_box_sphere`, `cornell_box_emissive`,
and `three_materials` (glossy) — all agree in converged radiance.
