"""GPU-free layout descriptor for the wavefront path-state record (P1 §P1-A).

Mirrors the `WavefrontPathState` struct in
``shaders/wavefront/wavefront_state.slang``. The renderer allocates the
path-state StructuredBuffer as ``stream_size * PATH_STATE_STRIDE`` bytes; the
Slang struct and this table must stay in lockstep or the wavefront stages read
garbage (``tests/test_wavefront_state.py`` locks them together).

Scalar layout (``-fvk-use-scalar-layout``): ``float3`` = 12 B with 4-byte
alignment, fields tightly packed.
