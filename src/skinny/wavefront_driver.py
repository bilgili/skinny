"""Backend-neutral wavefront stage-loop driver (design D1, change metal-wavefront-parity).

The staged wavefront path tracer's *stage order* — the tiled, counting-sorted
bounce loop — is identical on every backend; only the GPU command-recording
primitives differ (Vulkan records into a ``VkCommandBuffer`` with
``vkCmdDispatch``/``vkCmdDispatchIndirect``/``vkCmdPipelineBarrier``; Metal
encodes compute passes into a slang-rhi ``CommandEncoder`` with
``global_barrier``). This module holds the loop **once** and drives it through
the :class:`WavefrontRecorder` protocol, so each backend supplies only a thin
adapter that implements the primitive operations.

The Vulkan adapter lives in :mod:`skinny.vk_wavefront` (``_VkPathRecorder``) and
reproduces the prior inline ``WavefrontPathPass.record_dispatch`` byte-for-byte;
the Metal adapter (a later phase) implements the same protocol on slang-rhi.

This module imports no GPU backend — it is pure control flow over the protocol,
which keeps the stage order backend-agnostic and unit-testable with a recording
stub.
